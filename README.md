Ever wondered what your favorite pokemon type *really* was? Sure, maybe you think you like fire types, but then when you tried counting up how many pokemon of each type you liked you found out you actually like water types! 
Except that's not quite right either, because starmie, mudkip, and pyukumuku are great and all, but this doesn't account for how much you REALLY like flareon. Now what?

This is the train of thought that led me to creating this tool, and if you're in the same boat as me then you're in luck! The Ultimate Pokemon Liker is a tool that asks you how much you like each pokemon form on a scale of 1 to 10,
and then computes your average rating and standard deviation for each type. However, since type alone is not the only categorization for pokemon, this tool also tracks release generation, egg group, evolution stage, shape, and color!

To get started visit https://xaklor.github.io/Ultimate-Pokemon-Liker/ and follow the instructions shown to the right. When you've finished you can download a copy of your results as a CSV file and drop it into your spreadsheet
software of choice to look for any other trends you might find interesting, or just to share with your friends!
